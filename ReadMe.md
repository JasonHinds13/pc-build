# Building a Gaming PC in Jamaica

Building a gaming PC is something I've been wanting to do for a long time. The aim was to build one from parts that each cost less than $50 USD. I ended up getting all the parts except for the motherboard for a price under the limit.

## Constraints and Notes
- As I mentioned I looked for parts that cost under $50 USD. This decision was in attempt to avoid the Jamaica Customs import fee which, as of building it this PC, is charged on goods valued at over $50 USD.
- Due to the 2020 pandemic prices of computer parts have risen, especially GPUs, which is part of the reason I went for a CPU that comes with integrated graphics.
- Cost to clear items when they arrive in the country differ due to different factors such as weight and which freight fowarding companies were used.
- AMD was a good choice for this project, especially since they come with CPU coolers and sometimes thermal paste pre-applied.

## PC Specifications

AMD Athlon 3000G with Integrated Radeon Vega 3 Graphics  
16GB DDR4 3200 (2 x 8GB Sticks)  
256GB SSD and 1TB HDD

## Methodology
I used [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to locate parts, compare the prices across different sellers, and check for compatibility between the different parts. Started off by identifying which CPU I wanted to use, then finding a compatibile motherboard and RAM. I figured those were the most important parts to get out of the way first.

## Performace
It runs games quite well. So far I've tested it with games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Apex Legends and GTA V. I also used [UserBenchmark](https://www.userbenchmark.com/) for additional performance checks. The results can be viewed in the PDF included.

## Cost of parts

Prices may have varied since I purchased these. Some of these items had tax applied to them which brought the price up a little. In the case of the CPU the price was $49 USD but tax brought it to a little around $52. I was only charged for the value.
